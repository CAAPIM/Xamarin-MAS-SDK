# Xamarin-MAS-SDK
## for CA Mobile API Gateway

CA Mobile API Gateway (MAG) provides enterprises with a secure mobile backend that integrates systems and allows control over which users, devices, and applications can access your APIs. The MAG enables developers to leverage standards for API security such as (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, PKI) through client SDKs for Xamarin.

The Android Mobile SDK consists of these frameworks:

- MASFoundation - Core services to handle user authentication, device and app registration, requests and local storage of certificates, keys, and token credentials for accessing protected APIs.

## Features

* **Secure API Calls** - *Protect APIs with Mutual TLS and control API access on application, user and device level.*
* **Authentication** - *Implement authentication with username/password, Facebook, Google, Twitter sign-in.*
* **Single Sign-On** -*Share user credentials between your apps.*
* **Fingerprint Sessions Lock** - *Support phone unlocking using fingerprint recognition.*
